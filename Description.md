# Unity3D-AlienWorld
Watch FINAL/Demo.mp4

The main idea of this project was to build a space once used by an unknown alien civilization. I feel the scene here is quite simple and it does its job of portraying the goal.
The player starts, as if he fell through a crevice into a cave, the cave has some strange echoing sounds and at the opening of the cave there seems to be a sandstorm outside. As the player starts to get past the storm which has very low visibility, he is eventually greeted by strange large structures with some writings on it.
 The textures used were a mix of ones created by me, assets from class and some downloaded from “freepbr.com”. The sounds were recorded by me except for the cave sounds and the sci-fi music in the end which were downloaded from “freesound.org”. Also, the skybox here was obtained from “custommapmakers.org”.
I wasn’t able to include navmeshes, I had hoped to create my own models of some small creatures, but I was not able to finish the rest of the things in time. Also, I wanted the cave to have some stalactites but that was taking too much load on the system as I was using a combination of a probuilder object and replicating it with polybrush. Instead I created some black cuboidal crystals hanging from the cave ceiling.
